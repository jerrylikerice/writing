Mobile APPs have become indispensable to our daily lives. Although most of APPs are free, they oftentimes collect customer data which allow firms to profit. For this reason, consumer's concerns about the security of personal data on smart phones are at an all-time high. People worry, for example, misuse of the information in address book which would reveal trade secrets, or, leakage of daily routine stored in the calendar which might be shared with criminals. In 2012, Grace et al. conducted an thorough investigation which confirmed that many App vendors did collect user private information which is hard to justify, Savage and Waldman(2013) find on average customers are willing to pay \$5.06 to protect their privacy when using mobile APPs.  

According to classical economic theory, scholars widely acknowledge that insufficient competition would result in excessive prices and loss of consumer welfare. Ever since, policies that aim to promote competition have become an instrument for generating better social outcomes by directly influencing market structure. Similarly, by drawing an analogy between private data and price charged from APP vendors, it seems promoting APP competition would in consumer's interests and alleviate firm's desire for more customer data.

In this study we examine a fundamental question in the APP market: would competition reduce APP vendor's incentive to request customer information? To answer this question, one need to notice APP markerts have some unique characteristics: from APP vendor's side, APPs are highly differentiated. It may take big companies such as Facebook, Google millions of dollars to develop an APP but an amateur can develop a simple one in just a few days. The costs mainly comes from developing, but once developed, they are nearly free to reproduce or distribute. From user's side, APP marketplace allows easy comparison and download, so the search cost is low. And most of APPs are free, customers choose APPs based on our hetergeneou preference for quality and privacy. We incorporate these characteristics into theoretical analysis and surprisingly find competition may NOT affect firm's tendency to request customer data. This result is a result of equilibirum distribution of mobile APP quality and information request which follows a power-law pattern. We then use empirical data from two leading APP marketplaces in China to verify our conjecture.

According to APP Annie's 2016 annual report\footnote{https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/app-annie-2016-retrospective/}, Android App market is now offering almost 3 million APPs and this number on APP Store is more than 2 million. Among these APPs, more than 80\% Android APPs are free and nearly 70\% iphone APPs are free. These APP vendors, though don't charge money from customers directly, could base their profit on collecting customer data, for example, consumer preference information would allow firms to make better advertising strategy, consumers' location information and navigation history enable firms to conduct precise marketing.


On the other hand, consumer's concerns about the security of personal data on smart phones are at an all-time high. People worry, for example, misuse of the information in address book which would reveal trade secrets, or, leakage of daily routine stored in the calendar which might be shared with criminals. In 2012, Grace et al. conducted an thorough investigation which confirmed that many App vendors did collect user private information which is hard to justify, Savage and Waldman(2013) find on average customers are willing to pay \$5.06 to protect their privacy when using mobile APPs.  


According to classical economic theory, scholars widely acknowledge that insufficient competition would result in excessive prices and loss of consumer welfare. Ever since, policies that aim to promote competition have become an instrument for generating better social outcomes by directly influencing market structure. Similarly, by drawing an analogy between private data and price charged from APP vendors, one might automatically expect promoting APP competition would in consumer's interests in alleviate firm's desire for more customer data.


However, before directly borrowing the idea of price competition theory, one needs to note some unique characteristics of APP market. From firm's side, APPs are highly differentiated. It may take big companies such as Facebook, Google millions of dollars to develop an APP but an amateur can develop a simple one in just a few days. And the cost mainly costs from developing, meaning once developed, they are nearly free to reproduce or distribute. From user's side, APP marketplace allows easy comparison and download, so the search cost is low. And most of APPs are free, we choose APPs based on functionality and privacy preference.


In this study we seek to answer a fundamental question in the APP market: would competition reduce APP vendor's incentive to request customer information? Contrary to what convention wisdom would suggest, we surprisingly find competition may NOT affect firm's tendency to request customer data by incorporating APP market's characteristics into analysis. We testify our conjecture through both theoretical and empirical analysis. On doing this, we propose a APP competition model in which firms strategically choose quality and information request strategy. We explore some properties of APP market defined by our model and show how these properties lead to our conclusion. Empirical evidence turns out to support the theoretical analysis.
