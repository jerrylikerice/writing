 Since the marginal cost of changing 0 through a change in p is less than
 that of changing 0 through f, the equilibrium marginal revenue from p
 must also be less than that from f. But equations (21) and (22) indicate
 that the marginal revenue from p can be less if, and only if, ep > ef. As
 pointed out earlier, however, this is precisely the condition indicating that
 offenders have preference for risk and thus that "crime does not pay."
 Consequently, the loss from offenses is minimized if p and f are selected
 from those regions where offenders are, on balance, risk preferrers.
 Although only the attitudes offenders have toward risk can directly deter-
 mine whether "crime pays," rational public policy indirectly insures that
 "crime does not pay" through its choice of p and f.24
 I indicated earlier that the actual p's and f 's for major felonies in the
 United States generally seem to be in regions where the effect (measured
 by elasticity) of p on offenses exceeds that off, that is, where offenders are
 risk preferrers and "crime does not pay" (Smigel, 1965; Ehrlich, 1967).
 Moreover, both elasticities are generally less than unity. In both respects,
 therefore, actual public policy is consistent with the implications of the
 optimality analysis
 
 
 
 the loss would be minimized by setting p arbitrarily
 close to zero, for a " compensated " reduction in p reduces not only C but
 also 0 and thus D and bpfO.26
 There was a tendency during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in
 Anglo-Saxon countries, and even today in many Communist and under-
 developed countries, to punish those convicted of criminal offenses rather
 severely, at the same time that the probability of capture and conviction
 was set at rather low values.27 A promising explanation of this tendency is
 that an increased probability of conviction obviously absorbs public and
 private resources in the form of more policemen, judges, juries, and so
 forth. Consequently, a "compensated" reduction in this probability
 obviously reduces expenditures on combatting crime, and, since the
 expected punishment is unchanged, there is no "obvious" offsetting
 increase in either the amount of damages or the cost of punishments. The
 result can easily be continuous political pressure to keep police and other
 expenditures relatively low and to compensate by meting out strong
 punishments to those convicted.
