Is APP market competitive? if one looks at millions of APPs in the market the answer seems to be yes. Then if free competition promises efficiency and the best of consumer welfare, as most classical economic theory suggests, why we bother worrying APPs excessively request our private data? In this study we seek to answer a funndamental question in the APP market: would competition reduces APP vendor's incentive to request customer information?

According to APP Annie's 2016 annual report\footnote{https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/app-annie-2016-retrospective/}, Android App market is now offering almost 3 million APPs and this number on APP Store is more than 2 million. Among these APPs, more than 80\% Android APPs are free and nearly 70\% iphone APPs are free. These APP vendors, though don't charge money from customers directly, could base their profit on collecting customer data, for example, consumer preference information would allow firms to make better advertising strategy, consumers' location information and navigation history enable firms to conduct precise marketing.

On the other hand, consumer's concerns about the security of personal data on smart phones are at an all-time high. People worry, for example, misuse of the information in address book which would reveal trade secrets, or, leakage of daily routine stored in the calendar which might be shared with criminals. In 2012, Grace et al. conducted an thorough investigation which confirmed that many App vendors did collect user private information which is hard to justify.  

According to classical economic theory, scholars widely acknowledge that insufficient competition would result in excessive prices and loss of consumer welfare. Ever since, policies that aim to promote competition have become an instrument for generating better social outcomes by directly influencing market structure. Similarly, by drawing an analogy between private data and price charged from APP vendors, one might automatically expect promoting APP competition would in consumer's interests in alleviate firm's desire for more customer data.

However, before directly borrowing the idea of price competition theory, one needs to note some unique characteristics of APP market. From firm's side, APPs are highly differentiated. It may take big companies such as Facebook, Google millions of dollars to develop an APP but an amateur can develop a simple one in just a few days. And the cost mainly costs from developing, meaning once developed, they are nearly free to reproduce or distribute. From user's side, APP marketplace allows easy comparison and download, so the search cost is low. And most of APPs are free, we choose APPs based on functionality and privacy preference.

Contrary to what convention wisdom would suggest, we surprisingly find advocating competition would NOT reduce firm's intention to request customer data by incorporating these characteristics into analysis. We testify this conjecture through both theoretical and empirical analysis. On doing this, we propose a APP competition model which can explain the structure of APP market and possibly be applied to evaluate policy issues in APP market. Empirical evidence turns out to support the theoretical analysis. In the extension of this paper, we use this model to further evaluate the maximum privacy requirements standard policy.

Literature Review

Our research is also related to the economic aspects of privacy(). This stream generally aims to examine the incentives and trade-offs that emerge from the public and privacy spheres(). One related paper is Campbell et al (2015), in this work they study the impact of privacy regulation on market structure. They find the negative consequence of regulation falls disproportionately on smaller firms which could do harm to competitive market. Our work is different from theirs in that regardless how privacy regulation would affect the market in the later stage we examine how the market would like and how different market structure would influence privacy in the first place.
Another relevant paper is from Casadesus-Masanell and Hervas-Drane (2014). They also study how competition affect privacy but in a different setting, in their two-sided market the firms profit from both charging monetary price and disclosing customer information. They find competition need not result in high privacy as long as firm can translate competitive pressure to lower price and information disclosure. Our distinction is that there is no price instrument in our model so the reason that competition may not promote privacy result from totally differen mechanism. Without exception, all previous research only consider the monopoly or duopoly case but we generalize our model to multiple agents. We intepret this fact as our model examine the relationship between market structure and privacy in a more systematic way and the setting is closer to reality.
The second relevant stream evaluates privacy protection policies. For example, opt-in vs opt-out(), property right(), restriction on usage of personal data(Goldfarb and E.Tucker 2010), data breach disclosure(Romanosky et al 2011), personal data control(Tucker 2014). In general, these policies belong to two categories: reguation approach and self-regulation approach (Acquisti et al., 2016). The self-regulation approach is rooted in the idea that the free market tend to generate optimal outcome, so if customers are not satisfied with currect privacy options, competing firms always have incentives to provide an equivalent choice with better privacy options. Conversely, our study suggest this may not be the case.
Our analysis of APP market sturcture is also broadly related to the discussion about online market structure(). Basically, there are two dominate effects on online markets: "superstar"(Rosen 1991; Frank and Cook, 1995) or "information cascade"(), and “long tail” (Anderson, 2004; Brynjolfsson et al., 2006, 2010, 2011) effect. "super star" effect was used to explain income inequity and they find a marginal advantage is enough for super star to gain large markets(explain the phenomenon), (more explaination, software adoption, information goods). "long tail" distribution, on the other hand, argues  that the niche products gain a large share of total demands because of the availability of recommendation system and search tools. Until now, there is no general conclusion about under what condition which effect is more likely to happen, (more discussion). While in this study we suggest a potential important but less discussed factor, the type of differentiation, could explain why some markets are concerntrated towards the top list while others are concerntrated along the tail in APP market.

Advocators of the self-regulation solution to privacy problems holds the belief that the free market competition would automatically limit firms from invade customer information. Intuitively, firms should refrain from requesting excessive customer information in order to retain customers who can switch among competing APPs. Nevertheless, by comparing the information request across different APP categories we do not find evidence that competition has major impact on APP's information requests. More generally, APP vendor's quality, information request strategy seem to be irreponsive to more competing APPs.
Our explanation for this empirical puzzle is that the market equilibrium drives APPs to lower their quality and information request to a extent that their target customers nearly have no overlaps with leading APPs in the market. In traditional markets high differentiation often lead to natural oligopoly but in the information world the economics of scale and low entry barrier allows small firms survive even without serving the mainstream customers. This interpretation could possibly explain why may feel that APP market is largely a dominated market despite millions of alternative APPs in the market.

identifies a "market failure", where customers are not blessed with more privacy options or better privacy outcomes because companies find their best strategy is not to compete directly but to differentiate as much as possible.

depends on that free market tend to drive optimal solution so with strategic customers who can evaluate the benefits and costs of releasing one's privacy, firms are better off respecting privacy. So the main focus should be transparency and control. Recently, this approach has been questioned in the way that company can manipulate customer's peceived control of privacy which would lead users to take more risks with their personal information. Our work challenge this approach in an another way, the effectiveness of self-regulation could be questioned if competition does not promise more privacy option or less collection of private data.

relies on the assumption that firms would be refrained from invade customer privacy in the free competitive market through the mechanism of privacy-sensitive customer's adverse response. However, our work suggest self-regulation may not work if competition does not drive firms to take actions in favor of customer privacy.


free market would automatically drive optimal solutions. So if customers are really concerned with privacy, the market competition would offer more friendly privacy options for customer

approach relies on the assumption that free market competition would automatically firm tend to respect customer privacy more to as long as strategic customers "notice and consent" privacy usage.
the free market would drive firms to adopt privacy-friendly policies through customer self-selection.
